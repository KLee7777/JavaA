What did you like about this project?
The project is getting more challenging :)

What did you struggle with in this project?
Was struggling with variables not identifiable and it is the variables i key during practice sessions. So was not able to troubleshoot as it is not due to syntax errors.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?'
I guess the assessment is usually set a few notches tougher than what we experience during lessons which might not be a bad thing. But given my current coding standard, it is kind of tough to complete a fully workable solution.
